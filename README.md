**About Walmart**

Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.


**Business Problem**

The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).


Dataset

The company collected the transactional data of customers who purchased products from the Walmart Stores during Black Friday. The dataset has the following features:

User_ID:	User ID

Product_ID:	Product ID

**Recommendations**

Product 1, 5 and 8 are most demanded so enough quantity and good quality should be kept in stock of these products.

City B have more sales so, stock should be maintained there.

Targetting people who are living in city for atleast a year for shopping by attractive offers.

Men spend more money than women, So company should focus on retaining the male customers and getting more female customers. Giving additional offers for women can increase their spending on Black Friday.

Customers in the age 51-55 spend more money than the others, So company should focus on giving high customer care to this age group to continue getting the sales.

Highest frequency of purchase is between 5k and 10k, company can focus more on these mid range products to increase the sales.
